<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
    PayForAnswer.com was founded and created by its founder, Tom Bush. Tom was working as a software developer
    consultant. At the time he was working on a project and ran into an issue that he was having difficulty finding a
    solution for. While walking back to his office at work, he had the idea to have a website where people could post 
    questions, problems, and/or projects and offer money for the solution. 

    PayForAnswer was design with one end in mind: get an answer as fast as possible. PayForAnswer provides users a way to
    post questions and offer a monetary reward to the first user who answers the question. PayForAnswer is a company 
    based in Phoenix, Arizona.
