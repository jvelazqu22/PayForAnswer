<h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>
<p>
    Tip We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or reconfigure a PayForAnswer account, you provide 
    some personal information, such as your username, password, and email address. Some of this information, 
    for example, your username, is listed publicly on our Services. Some Services, such as search, public user user names 
    and viewing lists, do not require registration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Additional Information:</strong>  You may provide information to customize your 
    account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use your contact information to 
    send you information about our Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Questions, answers, and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to 
    help you pay for quesitons or get paid for answers while sharing information with the world. Most of the information 
    you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes any questions or answers you post. 
    Your posts are broadly and instantly disseminated along with your username. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Links:</strong> PayForAnswer may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our 
    email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. 
    We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate 
    click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data 
    and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and 
    looking at public posts. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard 
    disk. PayForAnswer may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our 
    Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and 
    improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by 
    changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you 
    visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the 
    Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring 
    web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie 
    information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, 
    sign into our Services, or interact with our email notifications. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Third-Parties:</strong> PayForAnswer uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, 
    such as hosting our various posts, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google 
    Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web 
    page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a 
    browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us 
    measure ad quality and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already 
    shown interest in. 
</p>

<h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or 
    disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal 
    request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect 
    PayForAnswer's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or 
    objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that PayForAnswer is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, 
    reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The 
    promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated 
    or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public username, questions posted, answers posted, or the 
    number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).
</p>

<h4>Modifying Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>
    If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify 
    the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.
</p>

<h4>Changes to this Policy</h4>
<p>
    We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of 
    your information and will always be at http://PayForAnswer.com/help/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our 
    sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @@PayForAnswer update or email to the email address associated with 
    your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound 
    by the revised Privacy Policy.
</p>
